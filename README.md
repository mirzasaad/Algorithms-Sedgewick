graph is digraph where vertices can be divided in groups
all acyclic graphs are bipartite graphs
cyclic graphs with even degrees are bipartite
digraph === bipartite

euler path === traverse every edge once (a connected graph is euler if all vertices has even degree)
hamitonian path === traverse every vertex once (not possible)
