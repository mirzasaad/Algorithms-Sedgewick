symbol table missing

practice mossris traversal postorder
2 - 3 tree missing
segment tree for sum
fix kdtree visalizer and performance is slow bas comapred to bst look into it


graph is Bipartite where vertices can be divided in groups
all acyclic graphs are bipartite graphs
cyclic graphs with even degrees are bipartite
digraph === bipartite

euler path === traverse every edge once (a connected graph is euler if all vertices has even degree)
hamitonian path === traverse every vertex once (not possible)

euler path mussing

hamilton path is missing

there is a difference between tringly connected and transitive close for directedGraph but means same thing for unidrected graph

look into TopologicalWithDegree
look into DynamicMST Book exercises
